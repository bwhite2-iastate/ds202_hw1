Felix Baez-Santiago, felbasa

What he did in the latest commit was add the homework files to the repo. The owner commit ID is e35c5fbec2bed0d36ce783672444dea145c6a7ac. Knitting was successful and did not encounter any errors. I made a spelling mistake on the html file so my partner had to help me find and rename it.
