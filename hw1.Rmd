```

This homework is more or less a tutorial that helps you set up the coding environment used in this course, and familiarizes you with the format of the assignment submission. 
As a pre-requisite of this homework, first install R, and then the RStudio (the free version of Rstudio Desktop). 

1. Create a folder named `ds202_hw1`, and **either** create an RMarkDown file `hw1.Rmd` under this folder **or** move the provided template into this folder. `hw1.Rmd` will include your solutions. The file and folder names are *case-sensitive*, which means `hw1.Rmd` and `HW1.rmd` are different. *It is crucial to follow the exact folder structure and file names* in this course, so that your homework can be reproduced. The correct folder structure is

    ```
    ds202_hw1
    |-- hw1.Rmd
    |-- hw1.html (generated after knitting)
    ```
    
    Answer: Done. (Note that the start of your answer on the next line must be indented. Don't remove the leading spaces.)

2. Write your name in the YAML of your homework `Rmd` file.

    Answer: Done.

3. Write a paragraph to introduce yourself. Set your name in bold font and your major in italic. 

    Answer: My name is **Brett White** and I am a third-year student majoring in *Software Engineering* with minors in Cyber Security and Data Science. I'm originally from Cleveland, Ohio, and this past summer I worked at Kingland Systems Corporation as part of its summer internship program. This semester I'm also enrolled in DS 301 and so I plan to learn a lot about data science. In future semesters, I plan on taking more advanced big data and machine learning courses in COM S and CPR E. I look forward to studying and interpreting real data in this class.
  
4. Write a paragraph describing a job that you think is related to data science. Include a hyperlink and an image. Make sure your answer is in a nice format to read. 

    Answer: One job related to data science is that of a [data scientist](https://hbr.org/2012/10/data-scientist-the-sexiest-job-of-the-21st-century "Data Scientist"). A data scientist uses statistical analysis to learn from data in order to help make complex business decisions. Data scientists often utilize machine learning algorithms to produce better results. Data scientists can work in any type of industry ranging from automobiles to finance. Data scientists don't need to be an expert in the specific industry in which they work, they just need to have access to all of the data that is collected so that they can generate models and learn from the data. Data scientists *can* specialize in specific industries, and this usually changes their title (e.g. a data scientist studying business can become a business analyst). The need for data scientists has grown significantly over the past decade, and now data scientists earn some of the largest salaries. The future of data science is bright, and companies will continue to need data scientists.

5. What data topic will you be most interested in? (Optional) Provide a source of such dataset if you have.

    Answer: I'm interested in machine learning using training and testing data. As for specific data, I'm interested in studying health, finance, movie, and sports data.
  
6. To check that your R and Rstudio installation is correct, find the version of R by entering `version` into the R console. Include this command into a R code chunk in your solution `Rmd` file to have it automatically printed in the knitted html file. 

    Answer: 
    ```{r}
    version
    ```
  
7. Install git. 
    - If you are on Windows: 
        a. Install [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/). In the coming weeks we will use the Git Bash (but not the Git GUI). 
        b. After installation, set up Rstudio to use Git bash as the shell for the Terminal: Open RStudio, click Tools--Global Options--Terminal; under **Shells**, select Git Bash; click OK. 
        c. In the main menu of RStudio: click Tools--Terminal--New Terminal. If you have a `$` before your prompt, then you should be good to go.
    - If you are on Linux or macOS, Git has probably been installed by default, so you do not need to install anything. Just click the Terminal tab (above the R Console).

    Answer: Done.
  
8. What is the version of your Git? To find out, go to the Terminal tab in RStudio (right to the Console tab), and type in the following command. If it works, this shows that the setup of your terminal and Git is correct. 
<!-- Then explore the bash command line and Git. -->

    ```
    git --version
    ```

    Answer: git version 2.28.0.windows.1
  
9. Configure your git username and user email by modifying and entering the following commands into the terminal

    ```
    git config --global user.name "your first and last name"
    git config --global user.email "yourEmail"
    ```

    Answer: Done.
  

10. Register a [GitHub](https://www.github.com) account. What is your username?

    Answer: bwhite2-iastate
